# Declaring of two variables that will take input of floating numbers from the users

firstNumber = float(input("Enter first Number\n>>>> "))
secondNumber = float(input("Enter second Number\n>>> "))

total = firstNumber ** secondNumber
print(total)

numbfirst = float(input("Ennter First Number:\n>>"))
numbsecond = int(input("Enter second Number:\n>>"))

mod_out_put = numbfirst % numbsecond
print(mod_out_put)

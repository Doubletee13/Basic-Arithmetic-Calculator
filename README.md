## BASIC ARITHMETIC CALCULATOR

This script is a script that will function as a basic arithmetic calculator that takes input of two floating(decimal) numbers from users and perform arithmetic operations on them.

The arithmetic calculator starts with an exponential calculation, therefore collaborators should firstly git clone the repository with the command:

> git clone https://github.com/Doubletee13/Basic-Arithmetic-Calculator

Secondly, to make sure the main branch is up to date, collaborators should run the commands:

> git checkout main

> git pull origin main

The above ensures they are working from the latest version of main

Thirdly, create a new feature branch with the command:

> git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name

The above, branch from the latest main branch to isolate their work

Fourthly, make changes, add and commit with the command: 

> git add .

> git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

Then lastly pushing with the command:

> git push origin feature/your-branch-name


Aside the exponential feature that is already on the script, each assigned collaborator should make contribution of the rest arithmentic operation feature of a calculator which are:

1. Addition
2. Substraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Modulus

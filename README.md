## BASIC ARITHMETIC CALCULATOR

This script is a script that will function as a basic arithmetic calculator that takes input of two floating(decimal) numbers from users and perform arithmetic operations on them.

The arithmetic calculator starts with an exponential calculation, therefore collaborators should firstly git clone the repository with the command:

> git clone https://github.com/Doubletee13/Basic-Arithmetic-Calculator

Secondly, to make sure the main branch is up to date, collaborators should run the commands:

> git checkout main

> git pull origin main

The above ensures they are working from the latest version of main

Thirdly, create a new feature branch with the command:

> git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name

The above, branch from the latest main branch to isolate their work

Fourthly, make changes, add and commit with the command: 

> git add .

> git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

Then lastly pushing with the command:

> git push origin feature/your-branch-name

After pushing your branch, go to the GitHub repository page and click the “Compare & pull request” button (or use the Pull Requests tab to create one). Select your feature branch as source and main as target, add a clear title and description, assign reviewers, then submit the pull request.

Aside the exponential feature that is already on the script, each assigned collaborator should make contribution of the rest arithmectic operation features of a calculator which are:

1. Addition
2. Substraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Modulus

NOTE: THERE ARE VARIABLES THAT TAKES FIRST NUMBER, SECOND NUMBER AND TOTAL, WE SHOULD WORK WITH THESE VARIABLES AS WE ARE MODYFYING THESAME FILE
